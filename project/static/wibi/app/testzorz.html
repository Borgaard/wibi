		<blockquote>This is a short description of adding a REST API route for accessing the Tip model via GET.</blockquote>

		<h4>
			The question: <br>
			Could you issue a PR on github.com/htrg/wibi? I'd like to see if you can add a REST api route for accessing the Tip model (only via GET). We're using Django REST framework.
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>In db.sqlite3, created 4 tips with ids, text and es_text.</li>

			<li>In shell, created 5th tip with id, text and es_text.</li>

			<li>In urls.py, created api/tip/:id url which accesses project/views/tip mod</li>el.

			<li>In views.py, created tip function with tipOutput object which fetches each item from the database by its id.</li>

			<li>In views.py, created conditional that says if the requested id is not empty, return the valid jsonOutput data. If requested id is empty, return an empty json object.</li>
		</ul>
		<small>Also, if this html file is in wibi/project/project/static/wibi/app, it won't show when server is run unless you're in the top wibi directory and do</small><br>
			<pre>mv project/static/wibi/app/testzorz.html project/static/wibi/dist/</pre>
		<small>To move it back so it can be committed to git (because dist is gitignored *sadface*), do</small><br>
			<pre>mv project/static/wibi/dist/testzorz.html project/static/wibi/app/</pre>
